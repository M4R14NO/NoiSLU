Repository for the paper  "[NoiSLU: A Noisy Speech Corpus for Spoken Language Understanding in the Public Transport Domain](https://doi.org/10.35096/othr/pub-7084)"
## Abstract
The use of local public transport requires the barrier-free purchase of a ticket. Travellers who are not proficient in the local language benefit from a multilingual human(ticket)machine voice interaction. This paper presents a nearly parallel audio dataset with 13218 annotated user queries from 20 speakers for English, German and Dutch. The domain-specific speech corpus can be understood as an evaluation dataset for future research in Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) and thus, it enables researches to improve the quality of human-machine interaction applications. Furthermore, we compare the SLU performance of different compositions of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) models in baseline experiments on different test datasets.
